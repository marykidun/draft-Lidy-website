              Camden School for Girls is steeped in history and has a long
              standing tradition of providing an exceptional education for all
              its students. The pioneering work of Frances Mary Buss and the
              dedication of the subsequent school leaders and staff has
              culminated in the tremendous institution that the school is today
              and I am honoured to take up the baton.
